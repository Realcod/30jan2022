/*
Ninja wanted to go to a party along with his friends. However, his mom wanted him to go only if he completes a task assigned by her.
She gave Ninja a value and asked him to print an X-shaped pattern.
Example : Pattern for N = 3 (No. of rows = 5, No. of columns = 5) :
1   1
 2 2
  3
 2 2
1   1
Since Ninja is in a hurry and doesnâ€™t want to be late for the party; he asks you to solve the problem. Can you help solve this problem?
